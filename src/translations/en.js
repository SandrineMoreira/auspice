        CoVSeQ is a partnership between
        the <a href="">Institut National de Sant&eacute; Publique du Qu&eacute;bec (INSPQ)</a> and
        the <a href="">McGill Genome Center</a> to sequence the viral genome of Quebec
        patients with COVID-19 disease. The viral samples are taken from a Quebec viral
        biobank, termed the CoVBanQ, which is hosted in
        the <a href="">Laboratoire de Sant&eacute; Publique du Qu&eacute;bec (LSPQ)</a>.
        The website is based on <a href="">Nextstrain</a>, an open-source project to
        harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. It
        provides powerful analytic and visualization tools to aid epidemiological
        understanding and improve outbreak response.
