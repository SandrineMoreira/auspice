The mission of the Institut de Santé Publique du Québec (INSPQ, Public Health Institut of Quebec) is a center of expertise and of reference for Public Health in Québec. Our mission is to support Québec’s Minister of Health and Social Services, regional public health authorities, and health and social services institutions in carrying out their public health responsibilities, by offering our expertise and specialized laboratory and screening services. Our objective is to improve the health status and the well being of the population. As a part of INSPQ, the Laboratoire de Santé Publique du Québec (LSPQ, Public
Health Laboratory of Quebec) is the reference microbiology laboratory of Québec.
LSPQ performs specialised analyses for the diagnostic and the surveillance of
infectious diseases
  
The Coronavirus Banq of Quebec is a biobanq of primary clinical specimen from COVID-19 positives patients collected by
Québec hospitals and centralized in LSPQ. Specimen collected are mainly aliquots from
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, saliva, broncho-alveolar lavage, expectoration,
tissues or feces.
